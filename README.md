## Problem

The challenge is to develop innovative solutions that leverage cutting-edge technologies to seamlessly digitalize and enhance product catalogs, offering a user-friendly experience for sellers and seller apps. Consider a sample catalog with at least 1000 SKUs, with attributes such as SKU id, product name, description, price, image, inventory, colour, size, brand, etc. This catalog is to be digitized using a combination of intuitive interfaces such as text / voice / image input, with text & voice input using any of the Indic languages. In some cases, a combination of these interfaces are required to digitize an SKU e.g. scan image which pre-fills the product name from the repository, with the remaining attributes filled using text or voice input.

## Solution

- Process Inefficiency and Time inefficient
- Resource Redundancy
- Catalog integrity issues, Image Quality and accuracy
- Lack of Standardization, Consistency Issues
- Multiple steps and clicks involved
- UX friction, CX pain points

## Deliverables

- Barcode Scanning
- Voice Input
- Vector Image search
- Mapping to master catalogue
- Download reported analytics
- Adheres to taxonomy
- Standardized and non-standardized product support
- Catalog Templates
- YOLO Model to detect items and fill their catalogue
- Seamless Multilingual Support Integration
- Robust chatbot which supports all major languages
- Dual backend and database integration options (Django and Nodejs)
- Bulk data addition and instant catalog creation
- Auto Filling Maximum Data
